# Reinforcement-learning-algorithms

The aim of this project is to understand and implement the major reinforcement learning algorithms: 
1. Dynamic Programming (Policy iteration and value iteration)
2. Monte Carlo estimation methods

We implement value iteration to solve Gamblerâ€™s problem and Monte Carlo method to maximize the result in the game of Blackjack, as defined in the book. The algorithms are implemented in Python using Open AI Gym platform for predefined environments.
